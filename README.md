# FraktalEngine
My own designed Fractal Engine, draw what ever you want and play around with fractlas!

## NOTE
This is very basic version of my project. Slow algorithm, not so pretty gui design and maybe not realy confortable usage. But it works,
and it will be getting better and better! Hope you enjoy

## Actual Version: BETA 0.9

## Previous Versions: -

## EXE Location just for fun:
This is whole Visual Studio project. If you don't want to look at code you can find a compiled .exe file in bin/debug directory

## ABOUT DOSEN'T WORK!
Yes, The simplest thing has no acction implemented xD But this is because I thought this is not so important, I will fix it soon
